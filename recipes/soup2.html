<h1> Healing Cabbage Soup </h1>
<img src="healingCabbage.jpeg">
<p> My body craves this cabbage soup whenever I have a cold, but it's equally delicious on a cold winter's night. It's so easy to make; add extra vegetables, leftover chicken, or rice for a more substantial meal. </p>


<h1>Ingredients:</h2>
<uol>
<li> 3 tablespoons olive oil </li>
<li> ½ onion, chopped </li>
<li> 2 cloves garlic, chopped </li>
<li> 2 quarts water </li>
<li> 4 teaspoons chicken bouillon granules </li>
<li> 1 teaspoon salt, or to taste </li>
<li> ½ teaspoon black pepper, or to taste </li>
<li> ½ head cabbage, cored and coarsely chopped </li>
<li> 1 (14.5 ounce) can Italian-style stewed tomatoes, drained and diced </li>
</uol>

<h1> Directions: </h1>
<p>
    <h4> Step one: </h4>
    In a large stockpot, heat olive oil over medium heat. Stir in onion and garlic; cook until onion is transparent, about 5 minutes.
    <h4> Step two: </h4>
    Stir in water, bouillon, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil, then stir in cabbage. Simmer until cabbage wilts, about 10 minutes.
    <h4> Step three: </h4>
    Stir in tomatoes. Return to a boil, then simmer 15 to 30 minutes, stirring often.
    <h4> Step four: </h4>
    Serve hot and enjoy!
