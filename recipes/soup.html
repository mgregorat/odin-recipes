<h1> Directions : </h1>
<h4> Step one: </h4>
Combine chicken, 1 onion, stems from the cilantro bunch, bay leaves, oregano, peppercorns, dried chili pods, and 3 quarts of water in a large soup pot set over medium-high heat. Bring to simmer, lower heat to medium-low, and simmer for 1 hour.
<h4> Step two: </h4>
Meanwhile, make the tortilla strips: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat or parchment paper.
<h4> Step three: </h4>
Cut tortillas in half, and then cut crosswise into 1/4-inch strips. Transfer tortilla strips to the prepared baking sheet and drizzle with oil. Add salt and toss well to coat, then spread strips out as evenly as possible.
<h4> Step four: </h4>
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and crispy, tossing once or twice during the cooking time, about 30 minutes. Set aside.
<h4> Step five: </h4>
Carefully remove chicken to a bowl. Reduce heat on broth to low.
<h4> Step six: </h4>
Let chicken rest until cool enough to pull off the meat. Shred chicken and refrigerate until needed.
<h4> Step seven: </h4>
Add bones, skin, and all the scraps back to the pot of broth, and simmer on low heat for about 4 hours total. If broth reduces too much, just add a splash of water.
<h4> Step eight: </h4>
Meanwhile, after about 2 hours, make the charred vegetable salsa: Preheat on the ovenâ€™s broiler for high heat and set a rack about 8 inches below the heating element. Line a baking sheet with foil and oil lightly; place remaining 2 onions, tomatoes, sweet red pepper, and jalapeno pepper on the prepared baking sheet.
<h4> Step nine: </h4>
Broil vegetables until charred, 7 to 10 minutes. Add charred vegetables to the jar of a blender with garlic cloves, chipotle pepper, and 1 cup water, and blend until smooth.
<h4> Step ten: </h4>
Pour pureed salsa into the pot, and raise heat to medium-low. Simmer broth for another 2 hours, stirring occasionally. Pass soup through a fine mesh strainer into a separate pot, squeezing the chicken to get all those nice juices; discard bones and skin in strainer. Season soup to taste with salt.
<h4> Step eleven: </h4>
Add cumin, shredded chicken, and juice from 1 lime. Simmer 15 to 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Taste for seasoning, and serve with crispy tortilla strips. Garnish with sour cream, avocado, chopped cilantro, grated or crumbled Mexican cheese, additional lime juice, and a sprinkle of cayenne, if desired.
